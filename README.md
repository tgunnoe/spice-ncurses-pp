The native ncurses c++ wrappers are undocumented and hard to use, especially if
you lack the thorough understanding of how base ncurses works.  I gave up trying
to move the cursor from a form to its menu buttons.


It was a good learning experience but I need to be more effective rather than
scratching my head 3/4 of the time.


I'm going to migrate this wallet name to my new QT wallet and rename this spice-ncurses++.


Here's the only resources I could find that were only somewhat helpful.
